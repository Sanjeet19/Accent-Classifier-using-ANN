# Accent-Classifier-using-DNN
The dataset used for the project are the audio files available on the http://accent.gmu.edu/. Each file was downloaded as a .mp3 file and then converted to .wav files using the application Audacity.

Project is still in progress. These codes are just a test version to get the data and see how accurate the ANN classification is.
